  <h1> Semester 1 Project</h1>
  <p>In my first semester at Hocking College I learned the following three things from HTML/CSS I and JavaSCript I </p>

  <ol>
    <li> CSS HTML JavaScript basic syntax </li>
    <li> Problem Solving skills </li>
    <li> The Computer Science Industry is always evolving</li>
  </ol>

  <p> I also think that W3Schools is a great resource to continue to learn more about web development</p>

  <p> The link to the web app we created from <a href="https://academy.hubspot.com/">HubSpot Academy</a> is <a href="https://bqlearn.com/hocking/insert%20link%20here">Web App</a></p>

  <h2> Certifications</h2>

  <p> I also completed my first certification with HubSpot Academy.  I 
    earned my Social Media certification.  Below is a copy of the 
    certification.
